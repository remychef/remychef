Hello! My name is Travis McGinnis and I'm very excited to be on Github :)
I love playing videogames, and it's why I joined a game developemnt program in highschool. I've been playing videogames since I was born and I don't think I'll ever stop. Getting into the hobby I played a lot of FPS games, but not I've moved to more competitive and team games.
I look forward to creating games that reflect my videogame interests and express my own personality.
Other than playing games I love to film and edit videos, mostly for a journalism proram but for personal enertainment as well!
In terms of game development, I've always loved coding and learning different coding languages. I studied how to create websites for a long time, and I hope that I can translate those skills into coding videogames using C++ and  Javascript!
My dream in game development was to always jsut make a game that I could personally be proud of, viewership and play count doesn't matter to me, I want to make something that I love myself and something that I can look back and be proud about.
I look forward to my journey in the game development industry and working with different kinds of teams on different kinds of games!
